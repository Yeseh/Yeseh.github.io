Welcome to my blog. My name is Jesse Wellenberg, and I&amp;rsquo;m a Software and Cloud engineer at Xebia in the Netherlands. I also like hacking around in my free time, and I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of open-source software. My technical interests are currently focussed on Programming Languages, WebAssembly, and platform engineering. Besides the ordinary programming work I like to sing, play guitar, and develop (sometimes even play) video games.</description></item></channel></rss>
